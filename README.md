I don't really know that much of coding
I just know variables and that's it
It's pretty annoying learning coding even on javascript because any little thing is hard for me to make
There are some people joking on class behind me.
I find coding fundamental to know because it can stay on your resume. Thus for the future it may be for great use.
I might as well try to use a fancier side of english in this repository
